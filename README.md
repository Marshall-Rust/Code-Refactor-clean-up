I made a few changes to the HTML, fixed the title. Changed some class to match the changes I made in the CSS.

Inside the CSS I made a lot of changes. I changed and simplified line 91. It had 3 different benefit-lead/brand/cost that all did the same thing. I changed them into a new name and wrote it out into 1 item. I did the same thing for line 96, took 3 different things that did the same, into 1 with a new name. I did it again on like 103. On line 109 I changed another 3 items into 1, however i could not simply it any further without items breaking. I had the same issues with line 118, and again at 122.



all of this was inside the other folder. I guess i didn't have it added here? 
and for the CSS file comments i added them here so it wouldnt clog up the css
